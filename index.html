            My name is <b style="color:beige">Rimpaldeep Dhillon</b>, and I am currently pursuing an Honours Bachelor of Science in 
            Computer Science at York University. I am in my fourth year of studies, gaining hands-on experience
            in software development, data structures, and emerging technologies such as machine learning 
            and artificial intelligence. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects that
            have strengthened my problem-solving and programming skills. I am set to graduate in August 2025 and 
            am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world software engineering roles.
